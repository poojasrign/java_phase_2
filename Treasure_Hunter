There is a treasure with some gold coins.
First, the Long tribe takes a certain percentage of the total gold.
From the remaining gold, the Black tribe takes another percentage.
The remaining gold is then divided equally among 3 people.
Write a program to:
Find how many gold coins the Long tribe gets
Find how many gold coins the Black tribe gets
Find how many gold coins each of the 3 people gets*/import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	    int gold=sc.nextInt();
	    int lon=sc.nextInt();
	    int black=sc.nextInt();
	    int long1=(gold/100)*lon;
	    int gold1=gold-long1;
	    int black1=(gold1/100)*black;
	    int gold2=gold1-black1;
	    int rem=gold2/3;
	    System.out.println(long1);
		System.out.println(black1);
		System.out.println(rem);
