/* Fibonacci Series
Write a program to find the nth term in the Fibonacci series using recursion.
Note that the first 2 terms in the Fibonacci Series are 0 and 1.
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
The term 5 in the Fibonacci series is 3
Explanation 0
The fibonacci series is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...., so the 5th term in this series is 3,
that's why the answer will be 3.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	static int fib(int n) {
		if(n==0)
			return 0;
		if(n==1)
			return 1;
		return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
			Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
			int n= sc.nextInt();
			System.out.println(fib(n));
	}
}

Output:
5
5
