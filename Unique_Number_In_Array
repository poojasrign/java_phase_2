/*
In a company, employees use their badges to check in and check out every day. Normally, 
each employee's badge is scanned twice once when entering the building and once when leaving.
However, due to a malfunction in the scanning system, exactly one employee's badge scan was missed, 
so their badge ID appears only once in the logs while all others appear twice.
You are given a list of badge scan records for the day. Find the ID of the employee 
whose scan is incomplete.
Input Format:
First line contains an odd integer N the total number of badge scans recorded.
The second line contains N space-separated integers representing badge IDs.*/


import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	    int num= sc.nextInt();
	    int arr[] = new int[num];
	    for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
	        arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
	    }
	    int res=0;
	    for(int n:arr){
	        res^=n;
	    }
		System.out.println(res);
	}
}

Output:
1 2 4 3 1 2 3
4
