Count distinct elements
Harish and Rajesh were developing a plan to find the ideal woman for Sheldon Cooper. 
There were puzzles, translations, and questions to check a person's ntelligence. 
One such question was to come up with a program to count the number of distinct elements in an array.
Harini is a postdoctoral researcher and a former graduate student of Caltech 
who is a huge fan of Sheldon's work and she wanted to impress Sheldon by
writing a program to count the number of distinct element in an array. Can you help Harini?
Sample Input:
5
1
2
3
3
4
Sample Output:
There are 4 distinct element in the array.
Explanation:
Since there are 4 distinct elements it will print There are 4 distinct element in the array.*/


import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	    int num= sc.nextInt();
	    int arr[]=new int[num];
	    for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
	        arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
	    }
	    ArrayList<Integer> ll = new ArrayList<>();
	    for(int x :  arr){
            if(ll.contains(x)) {
                continue;
            }
            else{
                ll.add(x);
            }
	    }
	    System.out.println(ll.size());
	}
}


Output:
7
1 2 3 2 1 2 1
3 // count of the Distinct Number
