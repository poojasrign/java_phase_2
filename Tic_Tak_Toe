/* question
Pradeep is designing the input interaction for X-O game (a.k.a TIC-TAC-TOE).
The user identifies the positions as 1|2|34|5|6|7|8|9. 
Since the board is a 2-dimensional layout (3x3), Pradeep uses a 2-dimensional array to store board 
status and he identifies positions by row, and column as for first-row elements -(0,0), (0,1),(0,2) 
and for second-row elements - (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) and for 3rd row elements - (2,0),(2,1),(2,2).
Help Pradeep to solve the conversion from user's input (1-9) to (Row, Column) (0-2),(0-2) respectively.
Note - Indexing for rows and columns is 0-based.*/

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	    System.out.println("Enter number between 0 to 9");
	    int position = sc.nextInt();
		int row = (position - 1) / 3;
        int column = (position - 1) % 3;

            System.out.println("Row: " + row + ", Column: " + column);
		
	}
}

Output:
Enter number between 0 to 9
6
Row: 1, Column: 2
