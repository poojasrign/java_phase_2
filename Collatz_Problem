/*
Collatz problem
Chander started working for Bing and he wanted him to write a program to generate Collatz Sequence. 
The rules for generating the Collatz sequence are: If n is even, n = n / 2 If n is odd, n = 3n + 1
For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is: 5 -> 16 ->8-> 4 -> 2 -> 1
It has been proved for almost all integers, that the repeated application of the above rule will result 
in a sequence that ends in 1.
Input Format
The input is an integer 'n' which denotes the first term of the sequence.
Output Format
As output, print the numbers in the sequence and also print the number of times the rule has to
be applied in order to reach 1.
Sample Input:
18*/


import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		int num=sc.nextInt();
		int count=0;
		while(num!=1){
		    if(num%2==0){
		        num=num/2;
		    }
		    else{
		        num=3*num+1;
		    }
		    System.out.println(num+" ");
		    count++;
		}
		System.out.println("total "+count);
	}
}

Output:
6
3 
10 
5 
16 
8 
4 
2 
1 
total 8

Explanation:
Step-by-step execution

num = 6

6 is even → 6 / 2 = 3

Output: 3
count = 1
num = 3
3 is odd → 3 × 3 + 1 = 10

Output: 10
count = 2
num = 10
even → 10 / 2 = 5

Output: 5
count = 3
num = 5
odd → 3 × 5 + 1 = 16

Output: 16
count = 4
num = 16
even → 16 / 2 = 8

Output: 8
count = 5
num = 8
even → 8 / 2 = 4

Output: 4
count = 6
num = 4
even → 4 / 2 = 2

Output: 2
count = 7
num = 2
even → 2 / 2 = 1

Output: 1
count = 8
Loop ends

When num becomes 1, the while loop stops.
Final output
total 8
