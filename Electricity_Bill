import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		double unit=sc.nextInt();
		if(unit<=200){
		    double price=0.5*unit;
		    System.out.println(price);
		}
		else if(unit<=400){
		    double price=(0.65*unit)+100;
		    System.out.println(price);
		}
		else if(unit<=600){
		    double price=(0.80*unit)+200;
		    System.out.println(price);
		}
		else if(unit >600){
		    double price=1.25+unit+425;
		    System.out.println(price);
