/*
Sum of even numbers and odd numbers
Mahe and Mani are playing a puzzle game with a given set of numbers.  
They need to find the sum of the odd number and the even number. Write a program to help them to solve 
the puzzle game.
Input Format
Input consists of n + 1 integers. The first integer corresponds to 'n', the size of the array. 
The next 'n' integers correspond to the elements in the array. Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.
Output Format
Refer to the sample output for details.
Sample Input:
5
2
3
6
8
-1
Sample Output:
The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16
The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2*/


import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int num= sc.nextInt();
		int arr[] = new int[num];
		int sum1=0;
		int sum2=0;
		for(int i=0;i<num;i++){
		    arr[i] =sc.nextInt();
		    if(arr[i]%2==0){
		        sum1=sum1+arr[i];
		    }
		    else{
		        sum2+=arr[i];
		    }
		}
		System.out.println("The sum of even number is :"+sum1);
		System.out.println("The sum of odd number is :"+sum2);
	}
}

Output:
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
The sum of even number is :12
The sum of odd number is :16
