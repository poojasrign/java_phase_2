/*Online Game
You are playing an online game. In the game, a list of N numbers is given. 
The player has to arrange the numbers so that all the odd numbers on the list come after 
the even numbers. Write an algorithm to arrange the given list such that 
all the odd numbers of the list come after the even numbers.
Input Format
The first line of the input consists of an integer num, representing the size of the list(N).
The second line of the input consists of N space-separated integers representing the values of the list
Output Format
Print Nspace-separated integers such thatall the odd numbers of the list comes after the even numbers
