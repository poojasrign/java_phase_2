/* 
Same or Not
The Modern World Cinderella was happy to meet Prince Charming at the ballroom and 
she danced with him happily. While she was dancing, Prince wanted to check whether Cinderella is a 
perfect match for him. He asked her a question to check her knowledge of Arrays. 
Can you help Cinderella to write a program to find whether the two arrays are the same or not?
Note: Two arrays are said to be the same if the sum of both arrays is the same and the size of 
the arrays is the same.
Input Format
Input consists of 2 integers and 2 arrays. The integers should correspond to the size of the arrays.
Output Format
If two arrays are the same, display "Same" else display "Not Same"*/


import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n1=sc.nextInt();
		int n2=sc.nextInt();
		int arr1[] = new int[n1];
		int arr2[] = new int[n2];
		int sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
            arr1[i] = sc.nextInt();
            sum1 += arr1[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n2; i++) {
            arr2[i] = sc.nextInt();
            sum2 += arr2[i];
        }
        if (sum1 == sum2) {
            System.out.println("Same");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Not Same");
        }
	}
}


Output:
3 // lenth of array1
3 // lenth of array2
3 4 5
6 2 4
Same
